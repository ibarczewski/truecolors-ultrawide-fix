# Life Is Strange: True Colors Ultrawide Fix
 
 This tool will enable Life Is Strange: True Colors to support your ultrawide (and super ultrawide!) monitors. The menus are not rendered in ultrawide, so you will not see the change until you enter the game.

 # Steps:
 1) Pick a resolution. This will be the resolution that the game will use moving forward.
 2) Browse to the executable. This is found at <InstallPath>/LifeIsStrange3/Siren/Binaries/Win64/Siren-Win64-Shipping.exe - MAKE A BACKUP OF THIS.
 3) Choose whether or not to apply the field of vision fix (fixes the FoV for ultrawide monitors - recommended and selected by default) and click patch.
 
 # Supported Resolutions:
 
* 1440x900
* 1280x1024
* 2560x1080
* 3440x1440
* 3840x1080
* 3840x1600
* 4120x1024
* 5160x1440
* 5292x1050
* 7680x1440

# Known Issues:
* When loading in a new scene, the sides of the scene will display, but the middle will be a black box as that part of the scene fades in. Not sure if I can fix this, but it's a relatively small issue.
* There is no error handling. If you do something wrong, the application will crash.
* You will have to rerun this each time the game is updated. The updates from Steam overwrite the binary file.
* You cannot revert this change, so either have a backup prepared or delete the exe and repair the game through Steam.
